# Readme
This is a little short story I wrote that unfolds along a maze. To read it, head over to the [demo](http://petestreet.github.io/branching-narrative-lime/), press the spacebar at any given room to view the story, and use the arrow keys to explore the maze.

Some rooms will display alternate content depending on whether you've visited them before.  All of the story's content (including alt-content) lives inside [Source Code/Content_1.js](https://github.com/petestreet/branching-narrative-lime/blob/master/Source%20Code/Content_1.js).

The "maze" functionality was originally based on a LimeJS [tutorial](http://www.gamedevacademy.org/create-a-maze-engine-in-html5/) I'd stumbled across, but I quickly ran into a design flaw and had to modify the original code to get it to work with a generic 2-dimensional map (see comments at the bottom of that article).  The unminified JavaScript is available in the "Source Code" folder.
