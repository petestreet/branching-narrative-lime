# Readme
This is a little short story I wrote that unfolds along a maze. To read it, head over to the [demo](http://petestreet.github.io/branching-narrative-lime/), press the spacebar at any given room to view the story, and use the arrow keys to explore the maze.

Some rooms will display alternate content depending on whether you've visited them before.  All of the story's content (including alt-content) lives inside [Source Code/Content_1.js](https://github.com/petestreet/branching-narrative-lime/blob/master/Source%20Code/Content_1.js).
